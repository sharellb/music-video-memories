## Music Video Memories - Easy -  Sharell Bryant (2024) 

## Project Statement
The project Music Video Memories started with the question, "What would it be like to work with my past self?" As a songwriter, I've often struggled to share the vivid images and ideas that come to me while writing songs. I wanted to create my own interactive music video for a song that’s still a work in progress, using earlier recordings, screenshots, and basic HTML to express myself visually.


Easy is the first video memory inspired by the nostalgia of late 90s and early 2000s websites. It takes you through the process of writing a song, featuring downloadable audio clips of my voice memos along with screenshots and images I found related to the song. The original idea came to me quickly during a songwriting class taught by Bridget Kearney (Lake Street Dive), through the virtual community School of Song.

In the music video, you’ll see a screen recording of a simple web page displayed in a Chrome browser. As you listen to the first audio clip of the song demo, you'll also see the webpage updating in real-time as I make changes using the Chrome Web Tools on the right side of the screen.


The website is publicly available and hosted on GitHub pages, and the corresponding code and materials are available in a public repository. I'm excited to continue exploring new technical tools to communicate and express myself as an artist. I want to find creative ways to use programming skills to independently release my music.


One of the biggest challenges for me was not knowing what emotions would come up as I listened to my old recordings. Would my memories match what I heard? How would I feel looking back at past images of myself? I discovered that approaching my past with kindness and curiosity, rather than judgment or embarrassment, helped me overcome my fear of sharing unfinished work. This process allowed me to create a visual and interactive piece for the song that feels true and unique to all aspects of my creativity.
